    <h2>This Is Where I Begin</h2>
    <p>
      For a long time, I thought success had to come first — that if I worked hard enough, built enough, or tried enough different things, I’d eventually earn the right to focus on what I love: making music.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve run businesses. I’ve written a book. I’ve built apps. And every time, I poured my heart into those projects chasing stability — chasing freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
     But truthfully? What I wanted all along was to sit in my room with nothing but a keyboard, Fruity Loops, and a clear head. Music isn’t my backup plan — it’s always been the core.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not here with a massive following or a million views. I’m here with one album, one voice, and the decision to stop waiting for perfect timing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is me starting from where I am. From zero, maybe — but finally on the right path.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you’re reading this, maybe you’re on your own version of that path. Maybe you’re building your way out of something. If so, I hope this music gives you some light, some momentum, or at the very least — something real to hold onto for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      More is coming. Two more albums are already in the works. Not because I have to "go viral" — but because this is what I <em>have</em> to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for being here.<br>
