    <h2>This Is Where I Begin</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve spent years chasing stability — thinking once life was figured out, I’d finally get to focus on music.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not here with a massive following or a million views. I’m here with one album, one voice, and the decision to stop waiting for perfect timing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is me starting from where I am. From zero, maybe — but finally on the right path.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you’re reading this, maybe you’re on your own version of that path. Maybe you’re building your way out of something. If so, I hope this music gives you some light, some momentum, or at the very least — something real to hold onto for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      More is coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for being here.<br>
